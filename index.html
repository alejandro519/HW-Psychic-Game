/*
You're going to make a game just like the one in the video. 
Essentially, the app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose. 

Put the following text on your page:

Guess what letter I'm thinking of
Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)
Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)
Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)
Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)

When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).
When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).
*/



//Define the variables that will be used for the game - some letters in the alphabet. This will be an array.

var letters = ["r", "s", "t", "l", "n", "e", "y"];

//Create variables that record the wins, losses and remaining guesses and their starting value

var wins = 0
var losses = 0
var guessesLeft = 9


//Record the number of times the user has chosen a letter in the array correctly. onKeyup.
document.onkeyup = function (event){

    var computerGuess = letters[Math.floor(Math.random() * letters.length)];
    console.log(computerGuess);
    
    var userGuess = event.key;
    console.log(userGuess);

    if ((computerGuess === "r") || (computerGuess === "s") || (computerGuess === "t") || (computerGuess === "l") || (computerGuess === "n") || (computerGuess === "e")); {

    if ((computerGuess === "r" && userGuess === "r") ||
          (computerGuess === "s" && userGuess === "s") || 
          (computerGuess === "t" && userGuess === "t")) {
          wins++;
          console.log("You Guessed Right!")
        }  else {
          losses++;
          console.log("You Lose!")
        }    

    }
}



//Record the number of times the user did not choose correctly

//Guess the number of guesses left for the user. forLoop

//Record and display the letters the user chose so far until the user wins or loses
